Basic Features:

- Clarify user login and load data flow
  --- Allow guests to use form without signing in, prompt sign in on "save playlist" click
- Custom recommendation filters for artists/tracks/genres
- Pin all / unpin all buttons
- Update IDB library based on Spotify library (check for new saved tracks utilising date added)
- Spotify icon somewhere
- Accessible tooltips & track features: use trigger click hover for toggle menus so hover on desktop but click on mobile
- Refetch recs with expanded criteria if no recs are returned from Spotify or indicator that none were returned
- Distinguish between clear data/log out?

Bugs?:

- Adding all recs to playlist, then clicking submit, recs hangs.
- If recs.size == 2 or 1, but fetching more only returns recs that are in the playlist, it will look like it's "hanging" with the SkeletonRows, because no more recommendations can be found
- Database deletion on logout/clear data
- Token expiry still an issue???
- Refactor circleOffset state to be only used within trackRow components.

Other:

- Organise styling with Mantine theme object
- Gradient background

Future Features:

- Replace target tracks with target time or give option for target time
- Move song order in playlist
- Right click to generate playlist from a track or artist
- Add volume slider to manage preview volume?
